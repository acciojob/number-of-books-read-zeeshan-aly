# Number Of Books Read

## Instructions

Write a JavaScript function called `numberOfBooksRead` that returns the number of books that have been read from the given object named `library`.

Each book object in the array has the following properties:

- `author` (string): the name of the book author
- `title` (string): the title of the book
- `readingStatus` (boolean): indicates whether the book has been read (true) or not (false)

The function should count the number of books in the array that have been marked as read (i.e., those with a readingStatus of true) and return that count as a result.
